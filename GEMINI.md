# Gemini Project Analysis: Vue PWA To-Do

## Project Overview

This is a **Vue 3** single-page application designed to function as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**. The primary goal is to create a modern To-Do list application.

- **Core Framework**: [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) using the `<script setup>` syntax (Composition API).
- **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) provides a fast development experience and optimized production builds.
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is used for type safety.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for utility-first styling.
- **PWA Functionality**: The `vite-plugin-pwa` is configured to make the application installable, work offline, and manage assets with a service worker. The manifest is set up with icons, theme colors, and display settings.

## Building and Running

Standard `npm` scripts are used to manage the development lifecycle.

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run Development Server**:
    Starts a hot-reloading development server.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Build for Production**:
    Compiles, type-checks, and minifies the code for production. The output is placed in the `dist/` directory.
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

4.  **Preview Production Build**:
    Starts a local server to preview the production application from the `dist/` directory.
    ```sh
    npm run preview
    ```

## Development Conventions

- **Component-Based Architecture**: The UI is built with single-file components located in `src/components`.
- **State Management**: For this project's scope, reactive state management will likely be handled within composable functions (e.g., `src/composables/useTodos.ts`).
- **Code Quality**: The project is set up with **ESLint** and **Prettier** to enforce a consistent coding style. It is recommended to integrate these into your editor.
- **PWA Assets**: PWA icons are located in `public/icons`. The service worker and manifest are automatically generated by `vite-plugin-pwa` during the build process based on the configuration in `vite.config.ts`.
